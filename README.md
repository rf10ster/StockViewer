`Carthage/Checkouts` and `Carthage/Build` excluded

*BTW* I had strange problems with carthage
- helped only deleting and recreating empty folder `Carthage`
- then update `carthage update --platform iOS`
- in this case not need to run `carthage bootstrap`

*Steps:* need to fetch the repository and run `carthage bootstrap`

+ install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)
+ open terminal and go to project directory
+ run `carthage update --platform iOS`
